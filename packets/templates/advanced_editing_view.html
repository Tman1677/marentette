  <h4>
    Advanced Editing
  </h4>
  <p>
    Basically the only reason anyone would have to do any editing to this site more advanced than adding videos is if I majorly messed up something making this, or someone wants to completely overhaul the site.
    Hopefully I didn't mess anything up because editing this is either going to take some experience with django or a lot of time to learn web frameworks.
  </p>
  <p>
    First off I'll just explain the setup of this site. It is a Django website being hosted with Gunicorn on a Heroku server with Heroku's built in Postgres database and all the styling of the website is done with Bootstrap 4.1.
    That was a mouthful. The source for the website is hosted <a href="https://github.com/SeaholmPhysicsStudent/marentette">on Github</a> by the "SeaholmPhysicsStudent" account I'm giving to Mr. Stukey.
    That source is then run on the SeaholmPhysicsStudent account on heroku for a free webserver. It takes a minute to spin up when it hasn't been accessed in a while but after that it's super fast.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're going to have any reasonable chance of fixing or adding to this website the main thing you're going to need to know is Django.
    I would recommend <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website" target="_blank">this guide</a> to Django as it is very detail and step by step.
    If there is anything wrong with the database use the SeaholmPhysicsStudent admin account I'm giving Mr. Stukey the credentials to and go to <a href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">the admin page</a> to fix something else.
    If you want to edit the Bootstrap color scheme or any other css provided you will need to write a scss file in the sass folder and then use gulp or some other sass compiler to generate the css in the right folder, don't edit the css straight up.
